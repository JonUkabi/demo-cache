# Caching dependencies in workflows demo

This is a demo on how to use the cache actions on GitHub Workflows to cache dependancies.

In this case we will cache the usual **node_modules** folder.

More information on cache on: [caching dependencies](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)
